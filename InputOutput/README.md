Programming Questions and Exercises : Input Output

Question 1.

Area and Circumference of Circle
Write a program that inputs from the user the radius of a circle as an integer and prints the circle’s circumference and area using the predefined constant Math.PI. Use the following formulas (r is the radius):
circumference = 2πr
area = πr2

Show the answer.

 

Question 2.

Area of Triangle
If a triangle has side lengths a,b,c, then the formula for the area of the triangle is area = √s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c), where s = (a + b + c)/2.
Write a program that asks the user to enter three sides of triangle. The program should compute and display the area of triangle.

Show the answer.

 

Question 3.

Celsius to Fahrenheit
