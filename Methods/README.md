Programming Questions and Exercises : Methods
Question 1

Write a program with a method named getTotal that accepts two integers as an argument and return its sum. Call this method from main( ) and print the results.

Show the answer.

Question 2

Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. Also write a program to test your method.

Show the answer.

 
Question 3

Write a value-returning method, isVowel that returns the value true if a given character is a vowel, and otherwise returns false. In main() method accept a string from user and count number of vowels in that string.

Show the answer.

Question 4

A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can be evenly divided only by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 4, and 6.
Write a method named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. Also write main method that displays prime numbers between 1 to 500.

Show the answer.

Question 5

A nonnegative integer is called a palindrome if it reads forward and backward in the same way. For example, the numbers 5, 121, 3443, and 123454321 are palindromes. Write a method that takes as input a nonnegative integer and returns true if the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false. Also write a program to test your method.
